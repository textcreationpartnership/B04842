         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I would only acquaint you with one thing in reference to what Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Armſtrong</hi> has ſaid: The King did indulge <hi>Holloway,</hi> that the ſpeaks of, is true, ſo far as to offer him a Trial, and his Majeſty perhaps might have ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it, but the Priſoner deſerves no ſort of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or Mercy, from the King. For it has appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Evidence that has been given of this late Horrid Conſpiracy, that after the Diſappointment that was given by the Providence of God, by the Fire at <hi>New-Market,</hi> to the meeting at the <hi>Rye,</hi> the Gentleman was one of the Perſons that actually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to go on upon the Kings haſty coming to Town then, and to deſtroy him by the way as he came to Town. And this appears upon a full and clear evidence, as poſitively teſtified as any thing can be. And when he was taken beyond Sea, Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Communication with Forreign Miniſters and other People were taken about him, and will be—</p>

               <sp>

                  <p>We are not to meddle at all with the Evidence, Mr. Attorney; that is not our buſineſs; here is an Outlawry, upon this Outlawry he is At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted, we have nothing more to do, but to do the Duty of the Court upon this Record before us, to Award Execution upon that Attainder, and we muſt give a Rule for it. If the King will be pleaſed to do for Sir <hi>Tho. Armſtrong</hi> what he did for <hi>Holloway,</hi> and indulge him a Tryal, and wave th' Out-lawry, with all our hearts. We are not diſpoſers of his Grace and Favour, but the Miniſters of his Juſtice. If the King will pardon him, he may; that is not our buſineſs; but all we have to do upon what is before us, is to conſider the Record, and what the Priſoner ſays againſt our awarding of Execution. We have Conſidered whether this be a Yielding within the Proviſo of this Statute, and we think it not, nor can be, by any means.</p>

Waſh it, and Sanctifie it by the Blood of the Immaculate Lamb, that taketh away the ſins of the World, that whatſoever defilements it may have contracted, in this miſerable, ſinful and naughty World, through the luſts of the fleſh, or the wiles of Satan, being purged and done away, it may be preſented pure and ſpotleſs before thee. And now, O Holy and moſt Merciful Saviour, thou moſt bleſſed Judge Eternal, ſuffer him not, ſuffer him not at his laſt Hour, for any Pains of Death to fall from thee. Support him by the aſſiſtance of thy Spirit in all agonies of Soul and Body at his laſt Moment; and teach us by this, and all other Spectacles of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, to number our Days, and to apply our Hearts to that Holy and Heavenly Wiſdom whilſt we live here, which may bring us hereafter to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               <head>The Paper he delivered to the Sheriff.</head>
               <p>I Thank Almighty God, though I have had but a ſhort time allowed me, I find my ſelf prepar'd for Death, and my thoughts ſet on another World, and truſt in God, well weaned from putting my heart on this; yet <hi>I</hi> cannot but give ſo much of my little time to ſet down in Writting my Anſwers to ſome Calumnies raiſed ſince my cloſe Impriſonment, as well as what Mr. Attorney accus'd me of at the <hi>Bar:</hi> I was told a very Great Perſon ſayes, I was a Spy of <hi>Cromwel's. I</hi> have been ſent from <hi>England</hi> by the beſt and conſiderableſt Friends the King had then, with Bills of Exchange for His Majeſties Uſe, and Letters of very great Importance to His Majeſty then at <hi>Bruxels;</hi> I appeal to His Majeſty, if I deliver'd them not ſafe to Him, and <hi>His</hi> anſwers too when I returned; Which <hi>I</hi> had not been above ſix Days but I was clapt up Ten weeks a cloſe Priſoner in the <hi>Gate-houſe,</hi> and in no ſmall hazard of my life for that Journey, Before this time, I had been a whole Year at leaſt in <hi>Lambeth-houſe</hi> a Priſoner, and after both theſe times a Priſoner in the <hi>Tower,</hi> when the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper</hi> Died, and near Starving in every One of them: Verily ill Treatments for a Spy and Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, My Lord of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and many others of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity will, <hi>I</hi> think, teſtifie my Innocency in this point; I proteſt before God <hi>I</hi> was never a Spy to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> or any other Man.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> laſt I was brought to the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> Bar on an Outlawry of High Treaſon, I was asked what I had to ſay for my ſelf, that Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Death ſhould not paſs; <hi>I</hi> was beyond Seas when the Outlawry came out, I thought a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:179956:3"/>Writ of Error to Reverſe it the Law allowed, I prayed I might be allowed a Tryal for my Life ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of the Land, I urg'd the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th: which was expreſly for it, it being within the twelve Months allowed by that Statute: It ſignified nothing, I was with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Roughneſs Condemned, and made a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, tho' Mr. <hi>Holloway</hi> a little before had it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him; I cannot but think all the World will conclude my Caſe very different; elſe why refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me?</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney ſaid, I was accuſed for being one of thoſe that was to Kill the King as he came from <hi>Newmarket,</hi> after the Fire, I take God to Witneſs I never had any Deſign, nor ever had ſuch a Thought to take away the King's. Life; neither ever had any man the Impudence to propoſe ſo Barbarous and Baſe a thing to me; neither was I ever in any Deſign to alter the Government of <hi>England:</hi> What I am Accuſed of more, I know no otherwiſe than by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports and Prints, which I take to be uncertain; So that it cannot reaſonably be expected I ſhould make particular Anſwers; If I had been Tryed I could have proved my Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s Baſe Reflections on me to be a Notorious Falſhood: For I know there is at leaſt Ten Gentlemen, beſides all the Servants of the Houſe, can teſtifie I Dined there that day.</p>
               <p>I have Lived, and now Die of the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, A <hi>True</hi> and Sincere <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And I heartily wiſh I had more ſtrictly lived up to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which I believed, and I have found the great comfort of the Love and Mercy of God, in and through my Bleſſed Redeemer, in whom I only truſt, and I do verily hope, that I am going to partake of that fulneſs of Joy which is in His Preſence, the hopes whereof doth infinitly pleaſe me.</p>
               <p>I thank God, I have no repining at my heart, for the condition my ſins have moſt deſervedly brought upon me; I have deſerved much worſe at the hands of God, ſo that I cheerfully ſubmit to this Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as being taken off but a ſmall time ſooner.</p>
               <p>I do freely forgive all the World, even thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in taking away my Life. As for the Sentence of Death paſt upon me, I cannot but think a very hard one, being, I think, denied the Laws of the Land.</p>
               <p>To conclude, as I never had any Deſign againſt the King's Life, or the Life of any man, ſo I never was in a Deſign to alter the Monarchy.</p>
               <p>I Die in charity with all the World, and therefore I heartily pray God to Bleſs the Church of Chriſt every where, theſe poor Nations, the King Majeſty; and I heartily commend my Soul, to Gods Infinite Mercy, through my Bleſſed Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
